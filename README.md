This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the `pygame` library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food (represented by a yellow block) to grow longer. The goal is to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body. When the game ends, the player can choose to restart or quit. It's a fun and classic game that demonstrates basic game development concepts like movement, collision detection, and scoring!
